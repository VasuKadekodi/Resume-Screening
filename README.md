# 🤖📝🔎 Resume Screening: Automating the Hiring Process 🤝💼

Looking to streamline your hiring process? 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♀️ Say hello to Resume Screening! 🚀 Our project utilizes the power of machine learning to automate the screening of resumes for job vacancies in your company.

No more tedious manual screening! 💤 Our approach ensures an efficient and objective process, eliminating any biases that may occur.

## 📊 Dataset:
Our dataset includes resumes of job applicants with various positions and relevant information such as education, work experience, skills, and more. After preprocessing the data and extracting relevant features, we analyze it with various machine learning techniques, such as supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, to identify patterns and extract insights.

## 📊 Dataset:
Our dataset consists of resumes of job applicants for different positions in your company. The data includes relevant information such as education, work experience, skills, and other relevant details.

## 🔍 Data Preprocessing:
We preprocess the data to remove irrelevant information, such as personal information and images. We extract relevant features such as education, work experience, and skills. We clean the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and special characters, and then transform it into numerical features using techniques like bag-of-words or word embeddings.

## 💻 Model Building:
Our machine learning models classify resumes into different categories, such as qualified and unqualified, based on the job requirements. We utilize supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes and random forests. Unsupervised learning algorithms such as clustering and anomaly detection are used to identify unusual or outstanding resumes.

## 📈 Results:
Our models are tested on a holdout set to ensure their generalization capability. We present the results in a clear and concise manner, including performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The insights are used to improve the screening process and to ensure that the selected candidates meet the job requirements.

## 🤝 Conclusion:
By using the right features and algorithms, our CV-Scanning project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in automating the process of resume screening. It helps you make data-driven decisions in your hiring process and ensures you select the most qualified candidates.

## 💻 ML Deployment:
We have deployed our ML model using pkl and vectorizer models, making it easy for you to integrate it into your hiring process. Try it out today! 🚀
